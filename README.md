# GPT-Presentation

This is an interactive video series website that teaches you about the innerworkings of ChatGPT, Large Language Models, and Artificial Intelligence training as a whole. I hope you enjoy!

Additionally, gpt.py is a simple python script that allows the user to input text from ChatGPT. The script changes some of the words using a thesaurus API, and with those changes it is undetectable as being written by ChatGPT to the new program GPTZero which can identify text written by the Large Language Model.

The site is hosted at: https://inspiring-arithmetic-41e11a.netlify.app/
